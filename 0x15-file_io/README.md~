# C - File I/O
In this project, I learned about the three standard file descriptors and their POSIX names as well as the difference between function and system calls. I practiced using the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.
